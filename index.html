        <h3>MealSpanWeb</h3>
        <p>A common issue amongst new university students is spending too much or too little,
          thus wasting their money. I created this web app with Python, Flask and JavaScript for the back end,
           along with HTML and CSS for the frontend to help students budget their meal plan accordingly.</p>

        <h3>MealSpan</h3>
        <p>The original program which inspired the creation of the MealSpan web app. This app
        was created in Python using Tkinter, Beautiful Soup 4, and Requests to gather information about
      students' meal plan spending habits and give them personalized recommendations.</p>

        <h3>Crazy Eights</h3>
        <p>A group project in which the popular card game Crazy Eights was developed using Java. A graphical
        interface was created to let the user interact with and view their deck. This project relied heavily
      of object-oriented programming and similar applicable concepts in Java.</p>

        <h3>10FastFingers Bot</h3>
        <p>Driven by my interest in typing tests, I created a bot in Python to automatically complete the 10FastFingers test based on the user's
        instructions. This bot was created using the Selenium framework for browser automation and Beautiful Soup for
      parsing the generated words.</p>
